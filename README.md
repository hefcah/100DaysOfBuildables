# 100DaysOfBuildables

Welcome to **100DaysOfBuildables** ðŸŽ‰  
This repository documents my journey during the **BuildableHQ Fellowship**, where Iâ€™ll be exploring **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** through real-world projects.  

The fellowship emphasizes **hands-on experience**, **collaborative learning**, and **building deployable solutions**.  
Over the course of 100 days, Iâ€™ll work on **3 projects** â€” two paired projects with fellows and one individual project to wrap up the fellowship.
